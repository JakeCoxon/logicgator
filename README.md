Logic Gator
===========

LogicGator or ‘Logic Gator’ is a program I wrote for my A-level computing project in 2010. Its aim is to help A-level students visualise logic gates with the flow of logic and also to help teach them simple simplification.

The program was written in Visual Basic .NET so you will need a newish version of the .NET runtime.
